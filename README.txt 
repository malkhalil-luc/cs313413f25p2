 TestIterator.java:
    TODO Question: Also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
        No difference; as test methods use iterator.
        Iterator interface defined by the List interface, List interface extends Collection which in turn
        extends Iterable.therefore, iterator is implemented by both ArrayList<> and LinkedList<>;
        so it has the same behaviour in this scenario.

    TODO fix the expected values in the assertions below
        i.next():
